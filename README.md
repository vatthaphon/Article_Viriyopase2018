## Introduction<a name="Introduction"/>
<p align="justify">This repository provides the implementation of the methods and algorithms described in the paper "Analyzing the competition of gamma rhythms with delayed pulse-coupled oscillators in phase representation". 
The main goal of this study is to theoretically investigate how ING and PING interact in a simple network of two oscillators. We generally find that we observe the same mechanisms of coperation and competition of gamma rhythms
as we found in [larger complex networks](https://pages.github.com/](https://github.com/vatthaphon/Article_Viriyopase2016) in the simple network.</p>This site was built using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
